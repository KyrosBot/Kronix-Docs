# Ratelimit Intervals

We're super serious when it comes to API abuse, and thus we have ratelimits to help reduce abuse. However, abusing the API numerous times will result in you being banned from using the Kronix API.

{% hint style="info" %}
These intervals can be changed at any given time with or without prior notice.
{% endhint %}

**Client Based:** 10 minute intervals.

**Webhook Based:** 5 minute intervals.
